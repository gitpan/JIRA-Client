Version: 0.29
Author:  Gustavo Chaves <gnustavo@cpan.org>

JIRA is a proprietary bug tracking system from Atlassian
(http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/).

This module implements an Object Oriented wrapper around JIRA's SOAP
API, which is specified in
http://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/rpc-jira-plugin/latest/com/atlassian/jira/rpc/soap/JiraSoapService.html.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL [--online-tests=JIRA_URL,USER,PASS,PRJKEY]
	make
	make test
	make install

The optional argument --online-tests enable some tests during 'make
test' that require an actual connection to a JIRA instance. The
argument consists of four pieces of information separated by
comas. JIRA_URL is the base URL of the instance (e.g.,
http://localhost:8080/). USER and PASS are the credentials of a user
that can log in to the JIRA instance. PRJKEY is the key of a project
in the JIRA instance in which USER has permission to create an issue
in.
